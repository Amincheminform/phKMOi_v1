Kynurenine 3 monooxygenase is a key enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP). 

hKMOi represents a novel therapeutic approach with broad implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, psychiatric disorders, acute pancreatitis, and immune-mediated conditions.

**phKMOi** stands for **p**redictor of **h**uman **KMO** **i**nhibitor. 

It is a <img src="https://streamlit.io/images/brand/streamlit-mark-color.svg" alt="Streamlit Logo" width="50"/>-based [Web Application](https://phkmoiv1.streamlit.app/) that predict the KMO inhibitory property (1 = Active, 0 = Inactive) of a small molecule and also visualizes the molecule with contribution of the features in the prediction.

This tool is a part of the article "*First 4D-QSAR study of kynurenine 3 monooxygenase (KMO) inhibitors: Integrating explainable artificial intelligence platform and chemical space networks for neurodegenerative diseases drug discovery*" (Manuscript under preparation).

---
The **phKMOi_v1.0** web application can be used by following [This Link](https://phkmoiv1.streamlit.app/).

Enter a SMILES string to predict its KMO inhibitory property, i.e., Active (Class: 1)/ Inactive (Class: 0)!
